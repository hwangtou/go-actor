Go-actor的目标是让开发者能够更加容易地使用actor模型。
The goal of go-actor is to make it easier for developers to use the actor model.

Go-actor为
With go-actor, it's convinience to create actors, with which developer
can receive message that send from actor-system. Actors implements Ask interface
can be asking for, and answer it. Package go-actor initializes a default actor
system, this system help developer to manage actors and their life cycle.

Call those spawn functions to create actors and get theirs reference. After
creating an actor instance, developer cannot operate to actor straightly,
but to send message or ask for answer via a reference of an actor. With a
actor reference, developer can also register it a name, and kill an actor.

Inside an actor instance, it will be called StartUp method to try starting up it
with the reference of itself, and the argument that has given in Spawn function.
If an actor started up successfully, its method Started will be called. To receive
others' messages with method HandleSend. And to implement the Ask interface to
support ask-answer pattern. In the end of the life cycle, method Shutdown will be
called, it's the last chance to save data.

Id is a concept that it is an identify of a specific actor. It contains a node id,
a actor id and a actor name. Node id is not zero if the actor is a remote actor,
and this id specify in which remote actor system the actor running. Actor id is
a non-zero number, to help actor system to find it, it just like the ProcessID
of OS. Actor name is a non-blank string if developer register a name to an actor
successfully. Developer should use this name to find an actor, because actors
might be shutdown and startup again, although they are in a same name, but the
actor id must be changed.

You can also use the actor.Remote, to connect to other actor.Remote, finding
an specific actor with name, send it message, or ask it for an answer. Now remote
message should be a ProtoBuf message, ProtoBuf is used in actor.Remote serializing.
